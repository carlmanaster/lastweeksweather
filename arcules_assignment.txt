2/11/2018, 2:19:27 PM I've got some time to look at this, so I'll get started.  Planning to use node, failables, probably express (if not node's built-in http server), not moment but that nice tidy replacement for it...  Yeah, https://date-fns.org/.  Plan of action:

1) create a GCP account (or resuscitate an old one I've forgotten) (I've used AWS and azure, not GCP yet)
2) create a darksky account
3) spin up a basic hello world service with express
4) write a minimal library wrapping darksky's api (just what I expect to use) with failables
5) add the input fields and buttons
6) ship it

2/11/2018, 2:38:38 PM GCP account created.  Nice and easy.
